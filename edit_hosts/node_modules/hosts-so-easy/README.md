Note: we support and run tests against latest Node, and Node v10 LTS (as of 2021-01-10).

## Features

  * [X] Built for safe and concurrent / parallel use.
  * [X] Add/remove funcs are (optionally) "use and forget" - no callbacks required.
  * [X] Preserves formatting (comments & whitespace choices) - see sample below.
  * [X] Changes are batched, atomic write is debounced 500ms (by default).
  * [X] Optionally keeps new entries in a separate "header" block.

## Usage

```js
import Hosts from 'hosts-so-easy';
const hosts = new Hosts();

// hosts file is written once at the end
hosts.add('192.168.0.1', 'www');
hosts.add('192.168.1.1', [ 'mongo', 'db' ]);

// this is completely safe, only one write occurs at the end.
for (let i = 2; i < 10; i++)
  hosts.add('192.168.0.'+i, 'host'+i);

// can remove individual hosts, all hosts for an IP, or a host from any IP
hosts.remove('192.168.2.1', '*');
hosts.remove('192.168.3.1', 'vhost20');
hosts.remove('192.168.4.1', [ 'mongo', 'db' ]);
hosts.remove('*', 'unwantedHost');
hosts.remove('*', [ 'unwantedHost1', 'unwantedHost2' ]);

// callback/promise after all changes synced in a single write
await hosts.updateFinish();
hosts.updateFinish().then(function() { ... }).catch(function(err) { ... });
hosts.updateFinish(callback);
hosts.on('updateFinish', callback);
hosts.once('updateFinish', callback);
```

## Options

```js
const hosts = new Hosts({

  // Write the new contents to a temporary file first and rename afterwards
  // instantly to avoid conflicts with other writers.  You'll know if you
  // need to turn this off (special filesystems, etc).  Either way, we always
  // check to avoid concurrent writes within the library.
  atomicWrites: false, // default: true

  // How long to wait after *last* add/remove before writing the file,
  // to write the file once even after performing many operations.
  // Even with a small value, we'll check to avoid concurrent writes.
  debounceTime: 500, // in ms, default: 500ms

  // Maintain a header block and insert new entries there.  See sample output
  // further down the README for an example.
  header: 'Docker hosts', // default: false

  // Linux/Mac default:  /etc/hosts
  // Windows default:    C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
  hostsFile: '/some/weird/location/hosts',

});
```

## API

### Methods

* `hosts.add(ip, host || [host1,host2])`

  For the given IP, add a single host or an array of hosts.

* `hosts.clearQueue()`

  If you had a change of heart, and call this in time, nothing will happen :)

* `hosts.on(event, callback)`

  `hosts.once(event, callback)`

  Run the given callback on every event occurrence, or just once when the event
  next occurs.  See EVENTS, below.

* `hosts.remove(ip || '*', host || [host1,host2] || '*')`

  For the given IP, remove the given host or all the hosts in the array.
  Alternatively, give a "host" of `*` to remove the entire line, or an
  "ip" of `*` to remove the given host(s) from any IP.

* `hosts.removeHost(host)`

  Remove all references of `host`, regardless of which IP it resolves to.
  This has the same effect as `hosts.remove('*', host)`.

* `hosts.updateFinish([callback])`

  If a callback is given, it's called at the end of the update sequence (see
  events, below).  If an error occurred, it's provided as the first argument.

  If no callback is given, a `Promise` is returned.  It resolves after a
  successful write, or rejects on failure.

### Events

* `updateStart` - fires at the beginning of update sequence.  Hosts file will
  be stat'd, read and rewritten.

* `updateFinish` - fires at the end of the above sequence.  On failure, the
  error will be provided as the first argument (file not found, permission
  denied, etc).

## Sample output (formatting preserved)

```js
const hosts = new Hosts({ header: 'optional header' });
```

```
#
# /etc/hosts: static lookup table for host names
#

#<ip-address>   <hostname.domain.org>   <hostname>
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
::1             localhost.localdomain   localhost

# optional header
172.20.0.2 host2
172.20.0.3 host3

192.168.0.2     server2
```

## TODO

  * [X] Ability to turn off atomic writes
  * [X] Maintain a header block (put hosts in same section)
  * [X] EventEmitter for writes
  * [X] Validate arguments, throw on invalid

## Wishlist

  * [ ] Callback / promise when particular host entry added.  Can't think of
        any use-case where the 'write' event would not be sufficient, but I'll
        add this if you give me a good reason.

  * [ ] Mimic preceding whitespace pattern for new entry insertion.

  * [X] Better caching for those doing A LOT of work on the file.
